---

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04)
- **Python:** Python 3.x
- **Rclone:** Installed via APT (version 1.50 or higher)
- **Python Packages:** Listed in `requirements.txt`

---

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Install or Upgrade `rclone` via APT

**Why Use APT Instead of Snap?**

Installing `rclone` via Snap can cause compatibility issues with cron jobs due to Snap's confinement and cgroup management. Using APT ensures that `rclone` operates with the necessary permissions and paths required by cron, avoiding errors like `/system.slice/cron.service is not a snap cgroup`.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Remove Snap Version of `rclone` (if installed):**

   If you have previously installed `rclone` using Snap, remove it to prevent conflicts.

   ```bash
   sudo snap remove rclone
   ```

2. **Update APT Package Index:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. **Install `rclone` via APT:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install rclone
   ```

   - This installs `rclone` from the official APT repositories.
   - Even in newer Ubuntu versions (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04) where Snap is the default, APT can still be used for package management.

4. **Verify Installation:**

   ```bash
   which rclone
   ```

   - **Expected Output:** `/usr/bin/rclone`

   ```bash
   rclone version
   ```

   - Ensure `rclone` is installed and reports its version without errors.

### 2. Configure `rclone` for OneDrive on a Headless Server

Configuring `rclone` for OneDrive typically involves a browser for authorization. On a headless server (without a graphical interface), you'll need to perform a manual authorization process.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Start `rclone` Configuration:**

   ```bash
   rclone config
   ```

2. **Create a New Remote:**

   - Type `n` to create a new remote.
   - **Name it:** `onedrive` (or any preferred name).

3. **Select the Storage Type:**

   - Choose the number corresponding to `Microsoft OneDrive`. As of recent versions, this is typically option `24`, but confirm in the prompt.

4. **Client ID and Secret:**

   - Press Enter to use the default client ID and secret.

5. **Edit Advanced Config:**

   - Type `n` for "Edit advanced config?"

6. **Use Auto Config:**

   - Type `n` for "Use auto config?"

7. **Generate Authorization URL:**

   - Since the server is headless, `rclone` will provide a URL that you need to open on a machine with a web browser.

   - **Example Output:**

     ```
     Please go to the following URL and authorize rclone:
     https://login.microsoftonline.com/... (truncated)
     ```

8. **Authorize `rclone`:**

   - Open the provided URL in a web browser on a different machine.
   - Sign in to your Microsoft account and grant `rclone` access to OneDrive.
   - After authorization, you'll receive a verification code.

9. **Enter the Verification Code:**

   - Return to your headless server terminal.
   - Paste the verification code when prompted.

10. **Finalize Configuration:**

    - Type `y` to confirm the configuration.
    - Type `q` to quit the configuration menu.

11. **Verify OneDrive Access:**

    ```bash
    rclone lsf onedrive:/
    ```

    - This should list the contents of your OneDrive root directory.

### 3. Clone the Repository

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory:**

   Choose a directory where you want to place the backup script.

   ```bash
   cd /home/user/
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drhdev/rclone_backup_to_onedrive.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd rclone_backup_to_onedrive
   ```

### 4. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies without affecting system-wide packages.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   - This creates a virtual environment named `venv` in the project directory.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   - Your terminal prompt should now indicate that the virtual environment is active.

### 5. Install Python Dependencies

The script relies on certain Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Ensure You Are in the Virtual Environment:**

   - If not already activated, activate it:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies Using `pip`:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   - This installs all necessary packages in the virtual environment.

   **Note:** The repository includes a `requirements.txt` file for easy installation of dependencies.

### 6. Test the Script Manually

Before scheduling automated backups, it's essential to verify that the script operates correctly.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive
   ```

2. **Run the Script with Verbose Output:**

   ```bash
   python rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py -v
   ```

   - **Notes:**
     - Running the script from within the project directory ensures correct path references.
     - The `-v` flag enables verbose output, displaying detailed logs in the terminal.

3. **Monitor the Output:**

   - The script will process the configurations and output logs to the console and the log file `rclone_backup_to_onedrive.log`.

4. **Verify Backups on OneDrive:**

   - Log in to your OneDrive account and navigate to the specified backup directories to ensure backups have been uploaded.

### 7. Set Up the Cron Job for Automated Backups

Automate the backup process by scheduling the script to run at desired intervals using cron.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Determine the Absolute Path of the Script:**

   ```bash
   pwd
   # Output example: /home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive
   ```

   - **Script Path:** `/home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive/rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py`

2. **Ensure the Script is Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py
   ```

3. **Edit the Rootâ€™s Crontab:**

   Running the cron job as `root` ensures access to all directories that require elevated permissions.

   ```bash
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

4. **Add the Cron Job Entry:**

   ```cron
   0 4 * * * /home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive/venv/bin/python /home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive/rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py >> /var/log/rclone_backup_to_onedrive_cron.log 2>&1
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - `0 4 * * *`: Runs daily at 4:00 AM.
     - `/home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive/venv/bin/python`: Path to the Python interpreter within the virtual environment.
     - `/home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive/rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py`: Path to the backup script.
     - `>> /var/log/rclone_backup_to_onedrive_cron.log 2>&1`: Redirects both `stdout` and `stderr` to a log file for monitoring.

5. **Save and Exit:**

   - The cron service will recognize and apply the new job automatically.

6. **Verify Cron Job Execution:**

   - After the scheduled time, check the cron log to ensure the script ran successfully.

     ```bash
     cat /var/log/rclone_backup_to_onedrive_cron.log
     ```

   - Look for `FINAL_STATUS` messages indicating `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` for each backup job.

## Configuration

### YAML Configuration Files

Backup configurations are defined in YAML files located within the `configs` directory. Each YAML file represents a separate backup job with its own settings.

### Example YAML Configurations

The repository includes two demo YAML files:

1. **`configs/config1.yaml`**

   ```yaml
   backup_name: "config1"

   backup_paths:
     /etc: false
     /var/www: true
     /home: true
     /usr/local/bin: true
     /path/to/exclude: false

   onedrive_remote:
     daily: "onedrive:/backups/config1/daily"
     weekly: "onedrive:/backups/config1/weekly"
     monthly: "onedrive:/backups/config1/monthly"

   retention:
     daily_retention: 7
     weekly_retention: 4
     monthly_retention: 12

   max_local_backups: 0
   ```

2. **`configs/config2.yaml`**

   ```yaml
   backup_name: "config2"

   backup_paths:
     /etc: true
     /opt/data: true
     /var/log: false

   onedrive_remote:
     daily: "onedrive:/backups/config2/daily"
     weekly: "onedrive:/backups/config2/weekly"
     monthly: "onedrive:/backups/config2/monthly"

   retention:
     daily_retention: 5
     weekly_retention: 2
     monthly_retention: 6

   max_local_backups: 0
   ```

### Customizing the YAML Configuration

You can create additional YAML files in the `configs` directory to define more backup jobs. Below is the structure and explanations of each field.

#### YAML Configuration File Structure

```yaml
# Required: Unique name for the backup job (defaults to filename if omitted)
backup_name: "unique_backup_name"

# Required: Paths to include or exclude in the backup
backup_paths:
  /path/to/include1: true
  /path/to/include2: true
  /path/to/exclude: false

# Required: OneDrive remote paths for backups
onedrive_remote:
  daily: "onedrive:/backups/unique_backup_name/daily"
  weekly: "onedrive:/backups/unique_backup_name/weekly"
  monthly: "onedrive:/backups/unique_backup_name/monthly"

# Required: Retention settings for backups
retention:
  daily_retention: 7     # Keep last 7 daily backups
  weekly_retention: 4    # Keep last 4 weekly backups
  monthly_retention: 12  # Keep last 12 monthly backups

# Optional: Number of local backups to retain (defaults to 0)
max_local_backups: 3
```

#### Field Explanations

- **`backup_name`:**
  - *(Optional)* A unique identifier for the backup job.
  - If omitted, the script uses the YAML filename (without extension) as the backup name.

- **`backup_paths`:**
  - *(Required)* A dictionary specifying which directories to back up.
  - **Key:** Absolute path of the directory.
  - **Value:** `true` to include in the backup, `false` to exclude.

- **`onedrive_remote`:**
  - *(Required)* Specifies the OneDrive remote paths for storing backups.
  - **`daily`:** Path for daily backups.
  - **`weekly`:** Path for weekly backups.
  - **`monthly`:** Path for monthly backups.
  - Ensure that the remote name (`onedrive:`) matches your `rclone` configuration.

- **`retention`:**
  - *(Required)* Defines how many backups to retain for each frequency.
  - **`daily_retention`:** Number of daily backups to keep.
  - **`weekly_retention`:** Number of weekly backups to keep.
  - **`monthly_retention`:** Number of monthly backups to keep.

- **`max_local_backups`:**
  - *(Optional)* Specifies the maximum number of local backups to retain on the server.
  - Defaults to `0` if not specified, meaning no local backups are kept after transfer.
  - Set to a positive integer to retain that number of local backups.

### Creating Additional YAML Configurations

1. **Navigate to the `configs` Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive/configs
   ```

2. **Create a New YAML File:**

   ```bash
   nano my_backup.yaml
   ```

3. **Define Your Backup Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   backup_name: "my_custom_backup"

   backup_paths:
     /var/www: true
     /home/user/documents: true
     /etc: false
     /opt/data: true

   onedrive_remote:
     daily: "onedrive:/backups/my_custom_backup/daily"
     weekly: "onedrive:/backups/my_custom_backup/weekly"
     monthly: "onedrive:/backups/my_custom_backup/monthly"

   retention:
     daily_retention: 10
     weekly_retention: 5
     monthly_retention: 12

   max_local_backups: 2
   ```

4. **Save and Exit:**

## Usage

### Manual Execution

Run the script manually to perform backups immediately or to test configurations.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment (if not already active):**

   ```bash
   source /home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive/venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /home/user/rclone_backup_to_onedrive
   ```

3. **Run the Script with Verbose Output:**

   ```bash
   python rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py -v
   ```

   - **Options:**
     - `-v` or `--verbose`: Enables verbose output, displaying detailed logs in the terminal.

4. **Monitor the Output:**

   - The script processes each YAML configuration, creates backups, and uploads them to OneDrive.
   - Detailed logs are written to `rclone_backup_to_onedrive.log` in the project directory.
   - If running with `-v`, logs are also displayed in the terminal.

5. **Verify Backups on OneDrive:**

   - Log in to your OneDrive account and navigate to the specified backup directories to ensure backups have been uploaded.

### Command-Line Arguments

The script offers flexibility in how configurations are processed.

#### Specifying YAML Configuration Files

You can specify one or more YAML configuration files to execute. If no files are specified, the script processes all YAML files in the `configs` directory in alphabetical order.

##### Examples:

1. **Execute Specific Configurations with Verbose Output:**

   ```bash
   python rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py config1.yaml config2.yaml -v
   ```

   - **Behavior:**
     - Processes `config1.yaml` and `config2.yaml` in the order they are listed.
     - Outputs detailed logs to the terminal.

2. **Execute All Configurations with Default Logging:**

   ```bash
   python rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py
   ```

   - **Behavior:**
     - Processes all YAML files in the `configs` directory in alphabetical order.
     - Logs details to `rclone_backup_to_onedrive.log` without displaying them in the terminal.

3. **Execute All Configurations with Verbose Output:**

   ```bash
   python rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py -v
   ```

   - **Behavior:**
     - Processes all YAML files in the `configs` directory in alphabetical order.
     - Outputs detailed logs to the terminal.

#### Running Without Specifying YAML Files

If you run the script without specifying any YAML files, it will automatically execute all YAML configurations found in the `configs` directory in alphabetical order, introducing a 5-second pause between each backup job to prevent resource contention.

## Restoration Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to restore backups created by the `rclone_backup_to_onedrive.py` script. These steps will help you retrieve backups from OneDrive, extract the data, and ensure the correct permissions and ownership are restored on your server.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before starting the restoration process, ensure the following:

- **Installed and Configured `rclone`:**
  - Ensure `rclone` is installed and configured with access to your OneDrive account.
  - Test with `rclone lsf onedrive:/` to verify connectivity.

- **Sufficient Permissions:**
  - You need read/write permissions to the directories where you will restore the data.
  - Running as `root` or using `sudo` is recommended.

- **`tar` Utility:**
  - Ensure `tar` is installed on your system for extracting backups.

### 2. Restoring Backup Files from OneDrive

#### Step 1: List Available Backups

Use `rclone` to list the available backups in your OneDrive. Replace `<backup_name>` and `<backup_directory>` with your specific backup configuration name and backup type (`daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`).

```bash
rclone lsf onedrive:/backups/<backup_name>/<backup_directory>/
```

**Example:**

```bash
rclone lsf onedrive:/backups/config1/daily/
```

#### Step 2: Download the Desired Backup

Choose the specific backup file you want to restore and download it to your local machine or server. Replace `<backup_name>`, `<backup_directory>`, and `<backup_file>` accordingly.

```bash
rclone copy onedrive:/backups/<backup_name>/<backup_directory>/<backup_file> /local/restore/path
```

**Example:**

```bash
rclone copy onedrive:/backups/config1/daily/daily-config1-20230903093000.tar.gz /home/user/restore/
```

### 3. Extracting the Backup

After downloading the backup file, extract its contents using the `tar` command. Ensure you specify the correct path where the backup should be restored.

```bash
sudo tar -xzf /local/restore/path/<backup_file> -C /target/restore/path
```

**Example:**

```bash
sudo tar -xzf /home/user/restore/daily-config1-20230903093000.tar.gz -C /
```

**Note:**

- Using `-C /` will extract the contents directly to the root filesystem, replicating the original paths. Ensure the target path does not overwrite important data unless intended.

### 4. Restoring File Permissions and Ownership

`tar` preserves file permissions and ownership by default. To ensure this explicitly, use:

```bash
sudo tar --preserve-permissions --preserve-order -xzf /local/restore/path/<backup_file> -C /target/restore/path
```

### 5. Verify Restored Files

It's crucial to verify the restored files to ensure the restoration was successful and data integrity is maintained.

- **Check File Integrity:** Manually check key files or use file checksums if available.
- **Check Permissions and Ownership:** Use `ls -l` to verify that files have the correct permissions.

**Example:**

```bash
ls -l /etc
```

### 6. Additional Considerations

- **Extended Attributes:** If your environment uses ACLs, SELinux contexts, or other extended attributes, ensure these attributes are correctly restored.
- **Testing:** Always test the restoration process in a safe environment before performing on a production server.
- **Automated Restore:** Consider scripting these steps if you frequently need to restore backups or plan to include restoration as part of a disaster recovery plan.

### 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Permission Denied Errors:** Ensure you are running the commands with the necessary privileges, e.g., as `root` or using `sudo`.
- **`rclone` Configuration Issues:** Re-run `rclone config reconnect onedrive:` if access to OneDrive is problematic.
- **File Not Found:** Double-check paths and file names, ensuring the correct case sensitivity.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Permission Denied Errors:**

   - **Cause:** Insufficient permissions to access or modify specified directories.
   - **Solution:** Run the script or commands as `root` or using `sudo`.

2. **Rclone Configuration Issues:**

   - **Cause:** Incorrect or incomplete `rclone` configuration for OneDrive.
   - **Solution:** Re-run `rclone config` to ensure OneDrive is correctly set up. Verify connectivity with `rclone lsf onedrive:/`.

3. **Cron Job Not Executing:**

   - **Cause:** Incorrect cron job entry or script permissions.
   - **Solution:**
     - Ensure the cron job path is absolute.
     - Verify that the script has executable permissions.
     - Check the cron log file (`/var/log/rclone_backup_to_onedrive_cron.log`) for errors.

4. **YAML Parsing Errors:**

   - **Cause:** Syntax errors or missing required fields in YAML configuration files.
   - **Solution:** Validate YAML files using a YAML validator or linter. Ensure all required fields are present.

5. **Snap-Related Errors:**

   - **Cause:** `rclone` installed via Snap causing confinement issues with cron jobs.
   - **Solution:** Ensure `rclone` is installed via APT as outlined in the installation instructions.

6. **Backup Not Found on OneDrive:**

   - **Cause:** Backup was not successfully uploaded.
   - **Solution:** Check the script log (`rclone_backup_to_onedrive.log`) for errors during the upload process. Ensure `rclone` has write permissions to the specified OneDrive directories.

7. **Missing Dependencies:**

   - **Cause:** Python packages not installed.
   - **Solution:** Ensure you are in the virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

8. **Script Execution Issues:**

   - **Cause:** Virtual environment not activated or incorrect Python interpreter.
   - **Solution:** Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` and ensure the cron job points to the correct Python interpreter within the virtual environment.
